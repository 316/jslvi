<p>You create news using <tt class="docutils literal">nikola new_post</tt>. This will create a RSS feed, which I suggest
you mirror into twitter using something like <a class="reference external" href="http://twitterfeed.com">twitterfeed.com</a></p>
<p>That way you can use the nice twitter widgets in your front page and display the news there.</p>
<p>You can edit and remove posts by just editing the contents of <tt class="docutils literal">posts/</tt>. For example,
it is probably a very good idea to remove this one before launching your event!</p>
