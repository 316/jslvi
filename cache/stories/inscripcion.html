<p class="first admonition-title">What should be here</p>
<p>A form to sign up for the event <em>if required</em>. It's possible to organize
an event without requiring this, sometimes. Describe <em>why</em> you are doing this.</p>
<p>I suggest using a google form, like this one. It will end in a spreadsheet
anyway.</p>
<p class="last">Describe any costs involved, remember to ask for things that are optional,
like certificates, t-shirts, lunch, etc, so you know what you need.</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to attend the Little Python Meeting please fill this form, it
will help us organize and make sure there are enough cucumber sandwiches
for everyone! There is no entry fee.</p>
<p>Remember to answer &quot;Yes&quot; if you want the attendance certificate, or you will
not get one.</p>
